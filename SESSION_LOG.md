# Session Log — CrowdComms Registration Dashboard

## Learning Approach
This is an educational project. Tom writes the code himself. Claude acts as a university lecturer — the "Mosh Next to Me" model:
1. Textbook explanations (what/why) → added to `DJANGO_DRF_COURSE.md`
2. Strategic doc navigation (filter the noise, point to the right sections)
3. Tom implements (the struggle is where learning happens)
4. Debrief and deeper understanding

Tom should be challenged. Don't give solutions. Explain the "why" and let Tom do the work.

## Prior Knowledge (from TaxConductor project)
Before this project, Tom built a Django tax calculator (`/Users/tomfyfe/codes/TaxConductor/`). Through that he learned:
- Django project/app structure, custom User model (AbstractUser, email-based auth)
- Migrations, admin setup, superuser creation
- Docker + docker-compose for Postgres
- Environment variables (.env)
- Django models: ForeignKey, on_delete (CASCADE vs PROTECT), DecimalField, CharField, Meta classes
- Plain Django views (function-based, returning JsonResponse)
- QuerySets: .all(), .filter(), .values(), .get() and their differences
- REST API principles, HTTP methods, content negotiation
- Installed DRF but hasn't created a serializer yet (understands the theory)

## Project Purpose
Building a registration dashboard inspired by CrowdComms' actual product (their Jan 2026 release). This gives Tom something specific and technical to discuss with the CrowdComms principal who interviewed him and is watching his LinkedIn.

## Target Role: Junior API Developer — CrowdComms (Remote, UK)
Salary: Up to £40,000

**Tech Stack:** Python, Django, DRF, FastAPI, Postgres, Redis, AWS (ECS, S3, CloudFront), Docker, Git, CI/CD

**Nice to Have:** FastAPI, Redis/caching, Celery/AMQP, Websockets

## Testing
Write unit tests as features are built using **pytest-django**. Tom has pytest experience.

## LinkedIn
Tom posts updates to LinkedIn documenting the learning journey. The CrowdComms principal is actively engaging with these posts.

## Current Phase
Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Models

## Current Status
- Starting from scratch
